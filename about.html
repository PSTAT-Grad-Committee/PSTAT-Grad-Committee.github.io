<p><b>Our primary goal is to foster a greater
  sense of community among the graduate students in the Department of Statistics and
  Applied Probability. </b></p>

<br>

<p> We are always looking for new members! Our current structure consists of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><u>Communications and Technology Officer</u></b></li>

    This officer is in charge of overseeing official communications with the department,
    and facilitating the exchange of information between faculty and graduate students. They
    may also be tasked with maintaining the website, discord server, and other resources.

    <br>
    <br>

    <li><b><u>Academic Events Coordinator</u></b></li>

    This officer is in charge of brainstorming new academic-oriented events in which
    students and faculty may participate. Duties include reserving spaces, reporting
    expenses to the Treasurer, and frequently checking the anonymous tips box for
    suggestions.

    <br>
    <br>

    <li><b><u>Non-Academic Events Coordinator</u></b></li>

    This officer has similar duties to that of the Academic Events coordinator,
    except with a greater focus on non-academic events.

    <br>
    <br>

    <li><b><u>Treasurer</u></b></li>

    This officer is in charge of overseeing expenditure, creating budgets for
    future events and communicating this budget with the department, and managing
    reimbursals.

    <br>
    <br>

    <li><b><u>Diversity and Equity Subcommittee</u></b></li>

    The primary goal of this subcommittee is to create a greater sense of diversity
    and inclusion within the department. This includes giving support and advice
    to students facing challenges, addressing and working toward resolving
    discrimination-related issues, and to monitor the anonymous surveys for
    suggestions/concerns that need to be addressed.


  </ul>
