## Mission Statement

As an organization, we strive to:

- provide streamlined communication between graduate students and the department,
- provide academic support for graduate students,
- engage with the department in social capacities,
- promote a diverse and equitable environment that encourages respect between all graduate students and faculty

:::

To that end, we currently:

-   host a series of [events](events.qmd)

-   maintain a graduate student [discord server](https://bit.ly/pstat-discord)

-   publish a quarterly newsletter to all currently-enrolled graduate students in the department


In the future, we seek to:

-   host a student-led seminar series, showcasing the current work of graduate students

-   interface further with the department's [DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiative](https://pstat-dei.github.io)
