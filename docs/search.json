    "text": "Though Isla Vista is the closest township to UCSB, it is admittedly a bit limited in what it offers. As such, it is fairly common for UCSB students to venture out to downtown Santa Barbara, either by car (12 minutes) or by bus (30 minutes via the 24X, 1hr via the 11).\n\n\nThere are (roughly) four distinct areas in Santa Barbara: State Street (sometimes called Lower State Street), Upper State Street, the Funk Zone, and the Mission. State Street boasts the most activities, both in terms of day-life and nightlife, whereas the Funk Zone excels primarily in its unique nighlife scene.\n\n\nSome recommendations for places to study in SB:\n\nCajé: Yes, this is the same Cajé that has a location in IV. But their location along Arlington street is quite a sight to behold! Formerly a Greek restaurant called Petros, Cajé retains a number of the chefs and staff from Petros and, as a result, offers an elegant and delicious spread of high-end Greek food! Additionally, the Arlington Cajé boasts a wide array of specialty drinks (non-alcoholic, but still a sight to behold). Be warned that outlets are limited, and that the majority of seating is outdoors.\nLighthouse Coffee: With several locations throughout SB, Lighthouse Coffee is a popular study spot among UCSB students. A major selling point is the ample presence of power outlets- a bit of a rarity in SB coffee shops!\n\n\nThis page is still under construction! More great things to come!",

    "section": "Getting To and From UCSB",
    "text": "Getting To and From UCSB\nThe nearest airport to campus is the Santa Barbara Airport (SBA), located just a 5-minute drive and a 17-minute bus ride from campus (the line 11 connects the North Hall Busloop and SBA). Though SBA is quite convenient for many domestic flights, be warned that it is a smaller airport and is not well-suited for long-distance travel; there are relatively few flights directly connecting SBA to non-west-coast airports, and there are zero international flights routing through SBA. The nearest larger airport is LAX (Los Angeles International Airport), located around 2 hours away by car (there also exists a shuttle between UCSB and LAX).\n\nThe main highway is Highway 101: it originates in San Francisco and runs through Santa Maria, Goleta, Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, and terminates in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nFood and Drink\n\nIf you are looking for a place to eat on Campus, your options are admittedly a bit limited. Current food options include:\n\n\nThe UCen (University Center): The UCen is the main on-campus center, functioning much like a Student Union Building. In addition to housing the University Bookstore, it also houses a few food options including: Panda Express, Root, Jamba Juice, Subway, and Santorini Island Grill. The dining-specific page of the UCen can be found here,\n\n\n\nOn-Campus “Markets:” There are also a handful of “Markets” located throughout Campus. The main such establishment is The Arbor, which conveniently is the closest establishment to South Hall (where the PSTAT department is housed). The Arbor stocks snaks and drinks, and also houses a Subway along with a Woodstock’s Pizza location around the corner.\n\n\n\nThe Hot Dog Cart: Official sources list this as Die Brezel (German for “the Pretzel”), though you will often hear this colloquially referred to as “The Hot Dog Cart.” One of the perhaps most underrated establishments on campus, this cart offers fresh-baked pretzels and hotdogs (with vegetarian options as well!), and is located just outside The Arbor.\n\n\n\nYoshinoya: The only Japanese-themed eatery on campus, the UCSB branch of Yoshinoya (which is admittedly a chain) is located in the Courtyard Café, near the Physics building. Though perhaps a bit far from South Hall, the food is usually worth the trek!\n\n\n \nThere are a few more options off-Campus, in the city of Isla Vista. Some highlights in IV include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoothies and Coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCajé: Cajé is a moderately-sized coffee shop, offering smoothies and smoothie bowls along with bagels (and, of course, your typical spread of café beverages: their Matcha Latté’s are quite good!) There are only limited power outlets, though, so be aware of that if you are planning on studying for a while.\nKozy Craft Coffee: Kozy is the newest coffee shop to open in IV, and is typically open from 7am - 4pm, 7 days a week. Admittedly, the coffee itself is nothing spectacular, but as a modern and fun space to study near campus, it is certainly a welcome addition to the IV landscape.\nIV Drip: The IV Drip is open fairly late, and boasts some of the best cookies around. (Several officers of this committee can personally attest!)\nBlenders in the Grass: A fairly common Smoothie/Juice-Bar chain, serving up decent smoothies and bowls for the slightly more health-conscious.\nOakberry: With several locations (including one in downtown Santa Barbara), Oakberry is a fairly popular place specializing in Açaí bowls (though they also have smoothies and other beverage items). Their Isla Vista Location is one of their newest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodstocks: Woodstocks Pizza is well-known among UCSB students. Though quite pricey, their pizzas are quite good, featuring thick crusts and copious toppings. Woodstocks also sports a hefty array of beers, making it a popular haunt among graduate students. Pro Tip: stop by at 9pm on Thursdays to partake in weekly Trivia games!\nIV Pizza and Pub: formerly a location of Pizza my Heart, the newly-opened IV Pizza and Pub serves up large New-York style slices of pizzas at a decently affordable price (at least, for IV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian/Fusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeddy Rice: Teddy Rice offers perhaps the most diverse set of cuisines in Isla Vista, under one roof. From Pan-Asian, to Mexican, to Middle Eastern - they’ve got it all! (We highly recommend the Omurice and the 빙수 [Bingsoo - Korean Shaved Ice]).\nAsia 101: Located at the former Phở Bistro location, this restaurant serves up a variety of Asian-inspired eats, and is one of the newer additions to the IV landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexican\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreebirds: Freebirds is fairly typical when it comes to Chipotle-style mexican restaurants (in the sense that food is made right in front of you), though Freebirds has the added benefit of being open fairly late (for IV) on most nights.\nZocalo\nMaria’s Tacos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n805 Boba\nPhresh Teas (operates inside Kaiju)\nMojo (operates inside Asia 101)\nAiCha\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Others! This list is by no means comprehensive!",
